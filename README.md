## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. **Clone the Repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/divyesh1099/compressPDF.git
cd compressPDF
````

### 2. **Install Python Dependencies**

It is recommended to use a **virtual environment**.

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contains:

```
Flask
PyMuPDF
pikepdf
```

### 3. **Install Ghostscript**

* **Linux/macOS:**

  * `sudo apt install ghostscript`
  * or `brew install ghostscript`
* **Windows:**

  * [Download Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html) and add the install directory (containing `gswin64c.exe`) to your **PATH**.

### 4. **Run the App**

```sh
python app.py
```

Now open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## üé® Usage (Web)

1. **Visit the site** and select one or more PDF files.
2. **(Optional):** Adjust JPEG image quality (10‚Äì100) for best compression/quality tradeoff.
3. Click **Compress PDFs**.
4. Wait for processing ‚Äì results (original/optimized size, percent reduction) are shown per file.
5. Download the compressed PDFs with a single click.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Compression Pipeline

**Each PDF is processed as follows:**

1. **Image Optimization (PyMuPDF):**

   * All grayscale/RGB images are re-encoded as JPEG at your desired quality if that makes them smaller.
2. **Stream & Structure Optimization (pikepdf):**

   * Deduplicate, compress, and object-stream all PDF internal data.
3. **Maximal Compression (Ghostscript):**

   * Downsamples vectors, fonts, and further linearizes and compresses the entire PDF.

> **Temp files are automatically cleaned. Batch uploads are supported out-of-the-box.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

* **Compression Quality:**
  The default is `75` (good for most cases).
  Lower = smaller PDF, higher = better image quality.

* **Ghostscript Quality Presets:**

  * `/screen` ‚Äì 72dpi, smallest, low-res
  * `/ebook` ‚Äì 150dpi, perfect for sharing/archival (default)
  * `/printer` ‚Äì 300dpi, best for print

  (You can add more or change defaults in the Python code.)

* **Output Directory:**
  All compressed files are saved in `compressed/`, which is **cleared before each batch**.

---

## üö© Deployment

* **For development:**
  `python app.py` (runs on `localhost:5000`)

* **For production:**
  Use a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, Waitress) and a reverse proxy (nginx, etc).

  ```
  gunicorn -w 4 app:app
  ```

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

* **Ghostscript not found?**

  * Make sure it's installed and on your `PATH` (`gswin64c.exe` for Windows, `gs` for Linux/macOS).
* **"Compression failed" errors:**

  * Check the console for details ‚Äì usually a corrupt or non-PDF file.
* **Large PDFs or memory errors:**

  * Consider increasing system RAM or compressing in smaller batches.

---

## üí° Customization

* **Branding & UI:**
  Tweak `index.html` and `success.html` for your own style, colors, and footer info.
* **Support more filetypes:**
  Extend the allowed files/extensions in the Python code if needed.
* **Add authentication, analytics, Sentry, etc.:**
  Standard Flask best-practices apply.
